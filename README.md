# List-Off!

Small Scale App Project completed during HND Software Development Year 1. This application was completed in Visual Studio's WinForms using C#, which consists of a small and simple to-do list application called "List-Off!". Initially the scope of the project was too large at the time and had to be lowered drastically at the time of implementation and submission.
